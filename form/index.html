jQuery Tools / FORM
"20 year wait is over. HTML5 is here."

The missing collection of Form Tools (6 kB!) to turn your forms into pure amazing.

Use HTML5 now (2 cols)
The above form is constructed with HTML and CSS. No hacks or tweaks. Pure HTML5 standard. 
Forms built with these tools work consistently on all major browsers &amp; even in IE6. What's really amazing is
that the form may have datepickers and sliders even when JavaScript is disabled!

Validate with standards &amp; and style
jQuery Tools form validation is easy to use, highly configurable and looks good. Most importantly,
it follows closely the HTML5 <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/#form-validation" class="external">Web Forms 2.0</a> standard. It takes the best parts of it and empowers it with the power of jQuery. The result is 
something that hasn't existed before: a solid, smooth HTML form validation tool.

Style your inputs
Every web designer has been struggling with the same problem: There is no way to style
select, checkbox, radio or file input fields. Not anymore. With Styleable tool you can
control the looks of your widgets with CSS. Borders, colors, background images. Everything.
You can style your existing forms and nothing will break even if you have been using 
JavaScript to manipulate the inputs. The widgets are even scriptable, just like before. 

The missing HTML5 slider 
The brand new jQuery Tools Slider element is an essential HTML5 widget for many different situations.
Write <samp>&lt;input type="range" /&gt;</samp> and you are done. This generic widget can also 
be used outside forms: you can make customized scrollbars, for example.

Datepicker done right
Here's another important form widget that follows the HTML5 standard. Place this widget on your page with  
the <samp>&lt;input type="date" /&gt;</samp> tag. The look and feel is flexible and can be styled
in radically different ways. It incorporates roughly the same feature set as in jQuery UI datepicker, but
80% smaller in size! In fact all the form tools presented here are smaller in size than the UI datepicker alone.
