	jQuery History @ jQuery TOOLS - Back button for AJAX apps
</h1>

<p>
	The History tool allows you to take control of the browser's back button. This means that when the user clicks on the browser's back or forward buttons you'll get notified.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<pii:code>
$("a.links_with_history").history(function(event, hash) {

});
</pii:code>

<p>
	You select a bunch of anchor tags from your page and supply a callback function that is called whenever the browser's back (or forward) button is pressed. The callback is only called when the browser navigates to any of the locations that are specified in the links' <samp>href</samp> attribute. Those <samp>href</samp> attributes must be <em>anchor</em> links; i.e. they start with the <samp>#</samp> character.
</p>

<p>
 	The callback is fed with two arguments. The first one is the jQuery <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Event" class="external">event object</a> and the second one is the anchor link (also called a hash) where the browser is navigating to.
</p>

<h2><em>Example</em> Tabs with history</h2>

<p>
	Use the following tabs together with back/forward buttons to see it in action:
</p>

<%@ include file="../demos/tabs/history.htm" %>

<a name="history_usage"></a>
<h3>Tabs initialization</h3>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>

<p>
	The history feature of the tabs uses this tool to enable the "back button". The feature is enabled by setting the <samp>history</samp> configuration variable to <samp>true</samp>. You can find above demo <a href="${jqt}/demos/tabs/history.html">here</a>. Here is another demo about <a href="${jqt}/demos/scrollable/one-sized.html">history feature in scrollable</a>.
