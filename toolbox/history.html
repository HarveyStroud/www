<h2 class="plugin">tabs.<em>history</em></h2>

<p>
	The History plugin enables history support for the tabs. This means that when the user clicks on the browser's back and forward buttons, the tool will navigate between the tabs and will not jump to another page. Use the following tabs together with back/forward buttons to see it in action:

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
	The best way to learn is to study the <a href="${jqt}/demos/tabs/history.html">full documentation</a> for the example above.
	For the impatient here is the JavaScript setup:
</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>

<h3><em>onHash</em> utility plugin</h3>

<p>
	This plugin comes coupled with a general purpose jQuery plugin called <samp>onHash</samp> that you can use to get a handle to the browser's back button in a cross-browser manner. Here is how you can use it:
</p>

<pii:code>
$("a.history").onHash(function(event, hash) {

});
</pii:code>

<p>
	You select a bunch of anchor tags from your page and supply a callback function that is called whenever the browser's back (or forward) button is pressed. The callback is only called when the browser navigates to any of the locations that are specified in the links' <samp>href</samp> attribute. Those <samp>href</samp> attributes must be <em>anchor</em> links; i.e. they start with the <samp>#</samp> character.
</p>

<p>
 	The callback is fed with two arguments. The first one is the jQuery <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Event" class="external">event object</a> and the second one is the anchor link (also called a hash) where the browser is navigating to.
