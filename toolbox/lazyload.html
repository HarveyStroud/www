jQuery Tools / Lazyload
Your pages can be faster

DEMO: Lazyloaded Scrollable

Lazyload is an utility to take full control of loading of your performance heavy assets: images, background images and non visible HTML.


We need faster websites
Lazyload enables you to control the loading of images, background images and HTML. If your page contains large images that 
are not visible yet there is no need to load all of them beforehand. This tool defers the loading of your assets until you
<em>really</em> need them making your pages work faster. Of course the tool itself weights only XXX kb when minified so it
does not hurt performance by itself. 
	
	
Integrate to your existing pages
Lazyload works out of the box. Add this call to your page <samp>$(":invisible").lazyload(true);</samp> and your done. 
If you have lot's of images this will have instant effect for your site. Your images are not loaded until they become
visible when user scrolls the page. View <a href="${jqt}/demos/util/lazyload.html">demo</a>.
	
		
Integrate to your JavaScript code
Lazyload already gives enormous power for Tabs, Overlays, Scrollables and Tooltips. They can now load large amount of data from the server
without consuming redundant bandwidth. You and can also extend your own JavaScript tools with Lazyload. There is a simple and powerfull 
API and event model and you can add customized <a href="#loaders">loaders</a> and appearance <a href="#effects">effects</a> when needed.
	
	
Load anything
Besides images you can also load any kind of HTML and if this loaded content contains more images they are also Lazyloaded!
The whole bunch of HTML and images are not revealed until the whole mass is completely loaded. Of course a progress indicator is
shown making your application responsive.
