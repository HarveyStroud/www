	<h3 class="first blue">Essential tools for modern websites</h3>

	<p class="more">
		Let's face it: do you really need drag-and-drop, resizable windows or sortable lists in your web applications? Websites are not desktop applications. They are different.
	</p>

	<img src="img/essential_tools.jpg" style="float:left;margin:0 25px -10px 0" />

	<p>
		What you really need are tabs, tooltips, accordions, overlays, high usability, striking visual effects and all those "web 2.0" goodies that you have seen on your favourite websites.
	</p>

	<p>
		This library contains the most useful JavaScript tools available for today's website. All of these tools can be used together, extended, configured and styled. You'll have many different widgets and new personal ways of using the library.
	</p>

	<p style="color:#bf17a2;font-weight:bold;">
		This library is open source and dual licensed under MIT and GPL 2+ licenses.

	<h3 class="first blue">Small size. Free CDN. High performance.</h3>

	<p class="more">
		This library weighs ${v.jqtSize}Kb. This is possible with good programming habits and compressed files
	</p>

	<img src="img/performance.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:25px" />

	<p>
		The file size is not the primary reason for high performance. The ability to combine tools into single file makes it performance friendly. According to Yahoo experts, this is the first rule for making highly responsive websites.
	</p>

	<p>
		Yahoo's second rule state: "Use a Content Delivery Network". Well, we will give you one for free! It has been configured with the proper expire headers and compression settings making the file load with the maximum performance possible. You can event use the CDN in production environments.

	<h3 class="first blue">For beginners</h3>

	<p class="more">
		You don't need to be a programmer to use these tools. We have lots of demos and you can copy their source code to your site and things will work.
	</p>

	<img src="${jqt}/img/user_basic.png" style="float:left;margin:0 25px 10px 0" />

	<p>
		Our demos use minimal HTML, CSS and JavaScript syntax and the crucial parts have been documented. You can use them as a template for your own work.
	</p>

	<p>
		And if you find suitable graphics you can freely use them on your site. In fact we have downloadable zip files for graphics designers that can be used as a starting point.
	</p>

	<p>
		Each tool is used in a similar manner and by learning one tool you can easily learn the other tools.
	</p>

<div class="col last">

	<h3 class="first blue">For serious programmers</h3>

	<p class="more">
		Each tool does only what it is supposed to do and nothing else. If you want modify this default behaviour, we offer clever ways of altering and/or extending it.
	</p>

	<img src="${jqt}/img/user_advanced.png" style="float:left;margin:0 25px 10px 0" />

	<p>
		The API design is probably the strongest area of these tools. The design patterns are understandable. We follow the UNIX tradition of providing tools - not policy.
	</p>

	<p>
		CSS is never mixed with code. This library takes this seriously. CSS is the ultimate tool for styling - not JavaScript.
	</p>

	<p>
		And above all, the library is constantly maintained and updated. Expect to see new releases coming out on a regular basis. The source code is hosted on Github. Enjoy!
