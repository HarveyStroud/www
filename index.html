	<h3>Essential tools for modern websites</h3>

	<p class="more">
		Let's face it: do you really need drag-and-drop, resizable windows or sortable lists in your web applications? 
	</p>

	<img src="img/essential_tools.jpg"/>

	
	<p>
		Websites are not desktop applications. They are different. What you really need is high usability, striking visual effects and all those "web 2.0" goodies that you have seen on your favourite websites.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This library is an answer to this need. All tools can be used together, extended, configured and styled. You'll find your personal way of using the library.
	</p>

</div>

<div class="col last">

	<h3>Small size. Free CDN. High performance.</h3>

	<p class="more">
		The UI part of this library weighs ${v.jqtSize} Kb. This is possible with good programming habits and compressed files
	</p>


	<img src="img/performance.jpg" />	
	
	<p>
		You can pick your own selection of tools from the download page or you can load the most common combinations directly from a free Content Delivery Network (CDN). 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The CDN is configured with the proper expire headers and compression settings so that the file loads fast. This CDN can be used in production environments without any charge.
	</p>

	<h3>For beginners</h3>

	<p class="more">
		A large demo area let's you copy &amp; paste working code directly to your pages. 
	</p>

	<img src="${jqt}/img/user_basic.png" style="margin:5px 30px" />

	<p>
		From each demo there is a minimal version without redundant HTML, CSS or JavaScript. You can use them as templates and fine tune them to your needs. A quick way to get started. You are also free to use and modify all the graphis you'll find.
	</p>

<div class="col last">

	<h3>For serious programmers</h3>

	<p class="more">
		Each tool does only what it is supposed to do and nothing else. Tools and not policy.
	</p>

	<img src="${jqt}/img/user_advanced.png" style="margin:5px 30px"/>

	<p>
		Understandable API design. Clean design patterns. Compact and human readable source code on <a href="http://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools" class="external">Github</a>. That's it.
	</p>

	<p>
		Learn one tool and you also learn the other tools.
