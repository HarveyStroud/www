<h2 class="first">Understanding <em>jQuery Tools</em></h2>


<p>
	jQuery Tools is a collection of the most important user interface components for the web. These are tabs and accordions, tooltips, overlays, exposing effects and scrollables. They can dramatically improve the usability and responsiveness of your site. They mainly focus on <em>presenting information</em> and <em>visual appeal</em>. After all, this is exactly what most websites desperately want: to present their content to the reader in an easy and visually pleasing manner.
</p>

<p>
	Other JavaScript UI libraries focus on desktop-like features such as drag-and-drop, sliders, sortable tables or draggable windows. They are meant to build "rich internet applications" (RIAs) such as email clients, task managers, CRM software, image organizers or feed viewers. These kind of applications are very useful within a small group or when used in intranets; however, normal websites are very different in nature. Their purpose is to look good and present information. jQuery Tools are built exactly for that purpose.
</p>

<p>
	It is recommended that you start designing your pages without using any JavaScript. There are many examples of highly functional, good looking and user friendly web sites that are not using JavaScript. The purpose of this library is to enhance an existing site with the great possibilities that modern JavaScript techniques has to offer. This is essentially the idea of "progressive enhancement" which is a common design pattern today. You should realize that highly professional sites don't overuse JavaScript just for the fun of it. Scripting is only used when it truly makes the pages more readable and user friendly. This is where these tools comes in to play.
</p>

<p>
	This library is not a framework with a steep learning curve, lots of preliminary work and strict coding rules. You are not tied to any predefined HTML or CSS structures. You can include the library on your pages and start using it immediately. You can freely design the look and feel of your site or you can use the design we have on our demos as a template.
</p>

<p>
	These tools can be easily combined. Think of scrollables that trigger overlays or overlays that contain scrollables together with tooltips or whatever combination you can imagine. The possibilities are endless. And if that is not enough, you can harness the enormous power of the jQuery library. Many times you see complex JavaScript components implemented that could be done with just a few lines of jQuery code. For many websites, this may be the only JavaScript library necessary.
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px">
	The old UNIX design philosophy <strong>"tools, not policy"</strong> is very important in web design.

<!--{{{ Flowplayer -->

<h2>jQuery Tools and Flowplayer</h2>

<p>
	You must have noticed that this project is hosted on the Flowplayer website. This is because some of the tools were initially developed for making widgets that work well with video sites. <samp>Scrollable</samp> was made for building playlists and <samp>overlay</samp> was made for showing videos over other elements on the page. Little by little those widgets matured to the point where they are now.
</p>

<p>
	Today Flowplayer and jQuery Tools have nothing specific to do with each other. Flowplayer is a video player and jQuery Tools is a generic user-interface library for the web. Of course, they can be used together because both are well behaving pieces of software. Here is a quick example of how videos can be overlayed on a page:
</p>

<pii:code>
// install flowplayer into a container element whose id is "player"
var player = $f("player", "/swf/flowplayer-${v.core}.swf");

// setup button action. it will fire our overlay
$("a.overlayLink").overlay({

	// when overlay is opened, load our player
	onLoad: function() {
		player.load();
	},

	// when overlay is closed, unload our player
	onClose: function() {
		player.unload();
	}
});
</pii:code>


<p>
	Flowplayer is Open Source software licensed with the GPL&nbsp;3 open source license. There are also commercial licenses that allow us to focus full time on the development of tools and the player itself. They also allow us to provide the free content delivery network for the users of jQuery Tools. There is currently no possibility of expressing your satisfaction through making a donation; however, if you are interested on showing videos on your site you could consider purchasing a <a href="/download/">Flowplayer commercial license</a>.
