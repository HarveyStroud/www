		<h3>HTML5 Form validation</h3>
	
		<p>
			jQuery Tools brings form validation to the level that it should have been 20 years ago. It's compact, fast and builds upon the best parts of HTML5 and Web Forms 2.0 standards. Use the new HTML5 input types or create your own. Together with jQuery these complex standards can be turned into pure amazing.

			Now you can use HTML5 date inputs on every modern browser in a consistent and standardized manner. Use CSS to do make skins that look like yours. Example skins are provided. Opera will render date input even if JavaScript is disabled.

		<h3>Totally new Scrollable</h3>  
		
		<p>
			The New Scrollable let's you have a complete freedom in "page" desing. You can have variable amount of items on a single page and the items can have variable width. The circular plugin functionality is now build inside the scrollable and is no longer in beta. Infinite loops are now rock solid and you can even add new items in a circular scrollable without breaking it. The new navigator plugin allows you to browse between pages with browser back and forward buttons and the browser history also works for dynamically added items.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			You'll get all this with a rediculous 3.3 kb file size. The smallest scrollable on the web is now 50% smaller!

		<h3>Toolbox. Set of tiny web essentials.</h3>

		<p>
			jQuery Tools is a collection of the most important UI components for the Web. Version 1.2.0 tightens this criteria. Flashembed and Expose are no longer part the UI tools. They are now part of a Toolbox which is a collection of tiny utilities that offer supporting features for the main tools. For example <samp>history</samp> allows both tabs and scrollables to use browser's back button.
		</p>
	  
		<p>
			All tools in the Toolbox also works as a standalone tool and there is no complex dependencies. Remember that this library is all about "Tools not Policy".  	
		</p>

		<h3>Smoother tooltips</h3>

		<p>
			Tooltip has undergone a significant rewrite. Just like scrollable the tool is now simpler and smaller but definitely zero compromises on the behaviour. On the contrary. This version has a dedicated tooltip for each trigger making it possible to have a separate animation for each. The tooltip element itself is automatically generated if not explicitly defined so you can simply write <samp>$(".mytrigger").tooltip();</samp> and that's all.

		<h3>Respecting jQuery community</h3>

		<p>
			Previous version had a handy configuratino variable <samp>api</samp> for accessing Tools programming API. Many people liked it but not all. After serious thinking I decided to drop it and go with the jQuery "community". Now you'll access the api with jQuery's <samp>data</samp> method and you can assign event listeners with the <samp>bind</samp> method. You'll feel at home with jQuery Tools.

		<h3>Github</h3>

		<p>
			There are two GitHub repositories: <a class="external" href="http://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools">jQuery Tools</a> and <a class="external" href="http://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools">Website</a>. With Github it's much easier to contribute to the project. I'm also just a contributor to it. Remember: It's about the code - not ego. And now with Github there is also a proper <a href="#">Bug Tracker</a>. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If you want to contribute please fork the project provide your changes to the Fork Queue. Of course I'm more than happy to discuss about the ideas before any coding starts. Please send your ideas by email trough Github. 
		</p>

		<h3>Closure Compiler</h3>

		<p>
			The combined size of the UI tools are now <strong>${v.jqtSize} kb</strong>. Smaller code is faster easier to understand. In JavaScript file size is a very important quality measure. Web is all about speed. The file size can be reduced mainly by writing better code but also by using a proper JavaScript minifier. By the time of writing Googles Closure Compiler generates smallest files.

		<h3>New copyleft policy</h3>

		<p>
			I generally don't like graffiti but a graffiti artist called Bansky <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/917press/2583620793/" class="external">makes a difference</a>. I took his copyright statement which says: "Copyright is for loosers" - how true that is. Copyrights are there just to block innovative thinking and humane life. People need to start sharing instead of owning. Ideally this is how everything should work. Of course our capitalist world works the opposite way resulting poor quality such as SAP or IBM. In many cases thousands of people are exploited on the act of capitalism (Nike, Nestle, Nokia,  Chiquita). 
		</p>
		
		<h3>New versioning policy</h3>
		
		<p>
			Previously each individual tool had an own version number. Now there is only one version number: the version of the jQuery Tools. Every tool belong to a single jQuery Tools version. Simpler.
