	This demo introduces you to some of the configuration possibilities of the dateinput. Following dateinputs are initialized with single <samp>$(":date").dateinput()</samp> call with a shared configuration. Additionally each input uses some HTML5 attributes for input specific configurations.

<h3>Dateinput initialization</h3>

<p>
	All three dateinputs are initialized with this single call. Look for the <a href="${jqt}/dateinput/#configuration">dateinput configuration</a> for the details of each configuration option.

<p>
	You need to place the <samp>script</samp> block <em>after</em> the HTML code or you can alternatively use jQuery's <samp>$(document).ready</samp> to execute the script as soon as the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM) has been loaded. Read more about that from the <a href="${jqt}/documentation/basics.html#document_ready">User's Manual</a>.
</p>

<h3>HTML5 attributes</h3>

<p>
	Native HTML5 date input supports two attributes <samp>min</samp> and <samp>max</samp> that can be used to set boundaries for the selectable day. The value must be in <strong>RFC 3339</strong> format such as: <samp>2010-12-22</samp> but this tool also accepts a numeric value meaning a number of days from the present day. <samp>data-value</samp> is the primary means of providing a default value for the input.
