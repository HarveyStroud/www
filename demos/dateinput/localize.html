<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
	The localization is done with <samp>$.tools.dateinput.localize</samp> <em>before</em> the dateinput initialization as follows:

<pii:code>
${js}

	For maximum safety we suggest that you encode special characters with the corresponding HTML entities. There are many lists on the web. I used <a href="http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/latin1.html" class="external">this one</a>.
</p>

<p>
	You need to place the <samp>script</samp> block <em>after</em> the HTML code or you can alternatively use jQuery's <samp>$(document).ready</samp> to execute the script as soon as the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM) has been loaded. Read more about that from the <a href="${jqt}/documentation/basics.html#document_ready">User's Manual</a>.
