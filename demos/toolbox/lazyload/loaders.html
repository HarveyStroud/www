	Lazyload is capable of loading images, background images and HTML elements. Here we have an example of all of these types. Click on the "load assets" button.

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
	Images and background images are defined normally. Background images can also be defined via an external stylesheet and they will still be lazyloaded. If you want to lazyload HTML the syntax can be taken from the third element. It is a wrapper element (typically <samp>div</samp>) enclosing a single anchor tag where the page to load is specified in the <samp>href</samp> attribute. This is standard HTML and is viewable by search engines and JavaScript disabled browsers too.

<pii:code lang="html">
${html}
</pii:code>

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>

</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>

<p>
	Enclosing your call inside <samp>$(document).ready</samp> executes the script as soon as the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM) has been loaded. Read more about that from the <a href="${jqt}/documentation/index.html#document_ready">User's Manual</a>.
