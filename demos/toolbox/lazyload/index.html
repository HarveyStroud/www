<p>
	This page has a couple of heavy images referenced from Flickr. Note that this page loaded quickly. The images are below the documentation section and they will only be loaded once they become visible. No redundant loading is done. Scroll down the page and you'll see lazyloading in action.
</p>

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
	We have enclosed the images inside a DIV so that we can select them easily with jQuery. 
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
<div id="loadables">
	<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2492/3942153630_38e1a62b2d.jpg" />
	<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2532/3720930469_66ffe057f8.jpg" /> 
	<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2160/2150890145_1b93f5c407.jpg" />
	<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/7/6481762_3d2c7e79f7.jpg"       />
	<img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1354/1302364866_23e7b2c681.jpg" /> 
</div>
</pii:code>

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
	Here we initialize lazyloading for the images. We supply <samp>true</samp> to the constructor which is identical to <samp>lazyload({loadOnScroll: true});</samp> meaning that we load images based on the scrolling position. There are other means of loading also that you will see on later demos.
</p>

<pii:code>
$("#loadables img").lazyload(true);
</pii:code>

<div class="box petrol">
	Here is the <a href="index.htm">standalone version</a> of this demo. You can freely study and copy its source code.
