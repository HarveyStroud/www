<p>
	Click on the submit button to see a custom validator effect. It shows the error messages inside a single container element instead of showing the errors on top of each field which is the default behaviour.
</p>

<%@ include file="custom-effect.htm" %>

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
	Here is our error container. The errors are appended inside the root element.
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
${html}
</pii:code>

<h3>CSS coding</h3>

<p>
	Styling for the error. <samp>position: fixed</samp> is used to make the container stay on a fixed place no matter what the scrolling position is.
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
${css}
</pii:code>

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
	Here is the custom effect. It is added with <samp>$.tools.validator.addEffect</samp> method as described in <a href="${jqt}/validator/#effects">Making custom effects</a> section of the validator documentation. The effect takes the container, makes it visible and adds the messages inside it. It is only triggered upon form submission and not when fields are edited. 
</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>

<p>
	You need to place the <samp>script</samp> block <em>after</em> the HTML code or you can alternatively use jQuery's <samp>$(document).ready</samp> to execute the script as soon as the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM) has been loaded. Read more about that from the <a href="${jqt}/documentation/basics.html#document_ready">User's Manual</a>.
