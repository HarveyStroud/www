	Submit the form below with invalid data or without anyt input and you'll see the validator in action.
</p>

<%@ include file="index.htm" %>

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
 	Here we have a form that has valid HTML5 syntax. We have used <samp>email, url</samp> and <samp>number</samp> inputs as well as normal <samp>text</samp> input with <samp>pattern</samp> attribute. <samp>requred</samp> attribute is used to indicate mandatory field. <samp>maxlength</samp> attribute makes it impossible to enter more than 30 characters.
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
<%@ include file="myform.jsf" %>
</pii:code>


<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
	This is the simple part. Simply initialize validator and you'll get all HTML5 niceties. 
</p>

<pii:code>
$("#myform").validator();
</pii:code>

<p>
	You need to place the <samp>script</samp> block <em>after</em> the HTML code or you can alternatively use jQuery's <samp>$(document).ready</samp> to execute the script as soon as the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM) has been loaded. Read more about that from the <a href="${jqt}/documentation/basics.html#document_ready">User's Manual</a>.
</p>

<h3>CSS coding</h3>

<p>
	We have given some spice for the error message. Note that <samp>height</samp> property should be give for the error message to ensure consistent positioning for every browser. We have defined <samp>label</samp> element as a block level element so that it appears on it's own "line".
