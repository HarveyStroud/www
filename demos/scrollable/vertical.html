<p>
	Here we show you a vertical setup for a scrollable. There is a minor change compared to the <a href="index.html">minimal setup</a> and it's recommended that you study that first before continuing. This scrollable has 12 elements in total and 3 elements are shown at a time. You can scroll these items by:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Clicking on the "more pictures" link.</li>
	<li>Using the up and down arrow keys.</li>
	<li>Using your mousewheel.</li>
	<li>Clicking on the last or the first item in the list.</li>
</ol>

<%@ include file="vertical.htm" %>

<h3>HTML code</h3>

<p>
	Our HTML structure is identical to the one presented in the "minimal setup" except that the items that are scrolled are more complex than just a single image. Also, the navigational buttons have been placed inside a wrapping <samp>DIV</samp>.
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
<div id="actions">
	<a class="prevPage">&laquo; Back</a>
	<a class="nextPage">More pictures &raquo;</a>
</div>

<!-- root element for scrollable -->
<div class="scrollable vertical">

	<!-- root element for the items -->
	<div class="items">

		<!-- first item. can contain anything -->
		<div>

			<!-- image -->
			<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/${img}_m.jpg" />

			<!-- title -->
			<h3>1. Barcelona Pavilion</h3>

			<!-- content -->
			<p>
				The Pavilion was not only a pioneer ...
			</p>

		</div>

		<!-- second item (and so on) -->
		<div>
			...
		</div>

	</div>

</div>
</pii:code>

<h3>CSS code</h3>

<p>
	We have used the following <a href="${jqt}/css/scrollable-vertical.css">CSS file</a> for above setup. Here are the crucial parts from the CSS file that are requred for a vertical scrollable:
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
/* root element for scrollable */
div.scrollable {

	/* required settings */
	position:relative;
	overflow:hidden;

	/* vertical scrollers have typically larger height than width */
	height: 665px;
	width: 700px;
}

/* root element for scrollable items */
div.scrollable div.items {
	position:absolute;

	/* this time we have very large space for the height */
	height:20000em;
}
</pii:code>

<p>
	In a horizontal scrollable the items are floating side by side by using the <samp>float: left</samp> property. In vertical scrollables this is not necessary.
</p>

<h3>JavaScript code</h3>

<p>
	We set the <samp>vertical</samp> property to <samp>true</samp> to achieve vertical scrolling. The <samp>size</samp> property defines how many items are visible at once. We don't want the items to be scrolled when clicked. This can be achieved by disabling the <samp>clickable</samp> configuration property.
</p>

<p>
	We use the <a href="${jqt}/scrollable.html#mousewheel">mousewheel plugin</a> to enable scrolling with the mousewheel.
</p>

<pii:code>${js}</pii:code>

<p>
	You might want to disable the <samp>clickable</samp> property if you don't want the items to be scrolled by clicking on them.
</p>

<div class="box petrol">
