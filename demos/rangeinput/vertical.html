<p>
	Here is four rangeinputs initialized with single <samp>$(":range").rangeinput()</samp> call with a shared configuration. Additionally each input overrides the shared configuration with HTML5 attributes. Try arrow keys or VIM keyboard shortcuts while having a focus on the input field.

<h3>Initialization</h3>

<p>
	<samp>vertical</samp> option makes ranges behave vertically and <samp>progress</samp> option enables the yellow progressbar which is styled with CSS. These configuration options are shared by all rangeinputs.

<p>
	You need to place the <samp>script</samp> block <em>after</em> the HTML code or you can alternatively use jQuery's <samp>$(document).ready</samp> to execute the script as soon as the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM) has been loaded. Read more about that from the <a href="${jqt}/documentation/basics.html#document_ready">User's Manual</a>.

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>                                               
	Here are the rangeinput elements. The shared configuration options are overridden with HTML5 <samp>min, max, step</samp> and <samp>value</samp> attributes. Look for <a href="${jqt}/rangeinput/#configuration">rangeinput configuration</a> for the descriptions and default values for these options. 
</p>

${html}

<h3>CSS coding</h3>

<p>
	We have used the <a href="css/skin1.css">same CSS file</a> as in our previous horizontal range but overridden it with following settings.
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
${css}
