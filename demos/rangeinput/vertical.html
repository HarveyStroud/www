<p>
	Here are four rangeinputs initialized with a single <samp>$(":range").rangeinput()</samp> call and thus sharing a common configuration. Additionally each input overrides the shared configuration with HTML5 attributes. Select an input field, and then try the effect of the arrow keys or the h, j, k, l VIM keyboard shortcuts.

<h3>Initialization</h3>

<p>
	The <samp>vertical</samp> option specifies a vertical layout of the range, and the <samp>progress</samp> option enables the yellow progressbar which is styled with CSS. These configuration options are shared by all rangeinputs.

<p>
	You need to place the <samp>script</samp> block <em>after</em> the HTML code or you can alternatively use jQuery's <samp>$(document).ready</samp> to execute the script as soon as the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM) has been loaded. Read more about that from the <a href="${jqt}/documentation/basics.html#document_ready">User's Manual</a>.

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>                                               
	Here are the rangeinput elements. The shared configuration options are overridden with the HTML5 <samp>min</samp>, <samp>max</samp>, <samp>step</samp> and <samp>value</samp> attributes. See the <a href="${jqt}/rangeinput/#configuration">rangeinput configuration</a> for the descriptions and default values of these options.

<h3>CSS coding</h3>

<p>
	We use the <a href="css/skin1.css">same CSS file</a> as in our previous horizontal range, we just override some of its directives:
